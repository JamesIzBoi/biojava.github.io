Become a contributor
--------------------

BioJava is made possible thanks to its diverse [developer community](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/graphs/contributors).
We always welcome new contributors, no matter the type or extent of the contributions.

If you already have some ideas or suggestions to improve the library, submit a new [issue](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/pulls) on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can explore some of the known [bugs](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) that need fixing or [feature requests](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+feature%22) from other users.
If you are unsure, contact us and we might be able to point out the ones suitable for newcomers and students.

Stay tuned
