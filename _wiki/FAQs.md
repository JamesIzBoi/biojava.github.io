**Q: Which macromolecular structure formats does BioJava support?**  
A: Currently BioJava supports parsing macromolecular structures in [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=file_formats/pdb/index.html), [MMCIF](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=file_formats/mmcif/index.html) and, as of version 5+, [MMTF](http://mmtf.rcsb.org/).
The library also allows conversion between the formats through the same internal representation as `Structure` objects.

**Q: How often are new versions of BioJava released?**  
A: There is not a fixed schedule for BioJava releases. Minor versions are released when there are important bug fixes to include, and as a fact we have released two major versions in the last six years.

**Q: I love the library, how can I support you?**  
A: Thanks! We are simple people, so just consider giving us a star in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/biojava/biojava/stargazers) and [citing the project]({{site.baseurl}}/about.html) if it was useful in your research.
