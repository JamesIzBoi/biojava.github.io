The BioJava project
-------------------

BioJava is an open-source project dedicated to providing a Java framework for processing biological data. It provides analytical and statistical routines, parsers for common file formats and allows the manipulation of biological sequences and 3D structures. The main goal of the project is to facilitate rapid application development for bioinformatics.

We have a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BioJava">Wikipedia page</a> (of course!) in case you would like to know more about the project.
